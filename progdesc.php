AdlMIDI is a commandline program that plays MIDI files
using software OPL3 emulation (FM synthesis).

", 'features:1. Key features' => "

<ul>
 <li>OPL3 emulation with four-operator mode support</li>
 <li>FM patches from a number of known PC games, copied from
   files typical to
   AIL = Miles Sound System / DMX / HMI = Human Machine Interfaces
   / Creative IBK.</li>
 <li>Stereo sound</li>
 <li>Reverb filter based on code from <a href=\"http://sox.sourceforge.net/\">SoX</a>,
     based on code from <a href=\"http://freeverb3.sourceforge.net/\">Freeverb</a>.
     A copy of either project is not needed.</li>
 <li>Number of simulated soundcards can be specified as 1-100 (maximum channels 1800!)</li>
 <li>xterm-256color support</li>
 <li>WIN32 console support (also tested with <a href=\"http://www.japheth.de/HX.html\">HXRT / MS-DOS</a>)</li>
 <li>Pan (binary panning, i.e. left/right side on/off)</li>
 <li>Pitch-bender with adjustable range</li>
 <li>Vibrato that responds to RPN/NRPN parameters</li>
 <li>Sustain enable/disable</li>
 <li>MIDI and RMI file support</li>
 <li>loopStart / loopEnd tag support (Final Fantasy VII)</li>
 <li>Use automatic arpeggio with chords to relieve channel pressure</li>
 <li>Support for multiple concurrent MIDI synthesizers (per-track device/port select FF 09 message), can be used to overcome 16 channel limit</li>
</ul>

<hr>
This project is <b>developed in C++</b>, but a <i>GW-BASIC version</i> is also provided
(<a href=\"http://bisqwit.iki.fi/jutut/kuvat/programming_examples/midiplay.html\"
>MIDIPLAY.BAS</a>).
This player was
<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwcFV3KrnQA\"
>first implemented in GW-BASIC for a Youtube demonstration video</a>!
With alterations that take 15 seconds to implement,
it can be run in QBasic and QuickBASIC too.
Note: The GW-BASIC version does not contain all of the same features that the C++ version does.

     Use banks 1-4 to play Descent \"q\" soundtracks.
     Look up the relevant bank number from descent.sng.

     The fourth parameter can be used to specify the number
     of four-op channels to use. Each four-op channel eats
     the room of two regular channels. Use as many as required.
     The Doom & Hexen sets require one or two, while
     Miles four-op set requires the maximum of numcards*6.</pre>
